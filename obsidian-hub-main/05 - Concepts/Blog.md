# Blog

%% Add a description below this line. It doesn't need to be long: one or two sentences should be a good start. %%
A blog is an online platform where individuals or organizations share their thoughts, opinions, experiences, or information on various topics. They are often presented in a chronological order, allowing readers to engage with the content through comments and discussions. However, this format is not all-encompassing and many variations exist. For example, both [[Obsidian Publish|Publish]] and [[Digital garden|Digital Gardens]] are a form of blog.
