# One-Shot

%% Add a description below this line. It doesn't need to be long: one or two sentences should be a good start. %%
A one-shot in Table-Top Roleplaying Games (TTRPG(s)) is a self-contained, shorter adventure that typically spans a few in-game days, offering a complete story experience within a few days or weeks, as opposed to the longer [[campaign]] arcs that unfold over months or years.
