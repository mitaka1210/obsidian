# Campaign

%% Add a description below this line. It doesn't need to be long: one or two sentences should be a good start. %%

In Table Top Roleplaying Games (TTRPG(s)), a campaign (sometimes called an Adventure) refers to an extended and continuous narrative that unfolds over multiple game sessions. It typically involves a group of players who, with the guidance and oversight of a game mediator, collaboratively explore and interact with a shared game world. It typically follows a central storyline or set of interconnected quests, allowing for character development, world-building, and the exploration of challenges and conflicts.
